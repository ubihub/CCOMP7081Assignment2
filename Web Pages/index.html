		Super Rent is a rental business that rents vehicles of varying types, models and prices.They have to handle multiple locations in different cities. Each location handles reservations and rentals from a verity of customers. The management of these assets falls to the manager of each location.
		</p>
		<p>The Super Rent Manager software will allow managers at SuperRent branches around the city to manage their stores stock of vehicles. We will create a number of tools that will increase Manager’s productivity such as the ability to search vehicles in the system either by category, age or location. Also the manager will be able to update or add vehicle entries in the system.</p>
		<p>The system will allow the manager access to stored vehicle entries. It will provide tools to modify and create entries quickly and easily. Also vehicles can be quickly search based on location or type. Vehicles will be stored based on location and type from economy, compact, mid-size and etc.</p>
		<p>Managers will be allowed access to functionality to sell vehicles out of the system. This will allow proper procedure is followed when selling old vehicles that Super Rent doesn’t want anymore. This will allow for the company to make back a portion of their investment at the end of the vehicles life span. Well stream lining the process for all involved.</p>

	<p>
	The SuperRent car rental company requires manager level software. This system will implement a database to store car information, and an interface to allow for business transactions and data manipulation. SuperRent rents a large number of vehicles of varying types, ages, values, and locations.
	</p>
	<p>
	This massive amount of information requires a system to streamline interaction between it and its users. SuperRent management needs this to access vehicle information across their many locations. Allow control over selling vehicles and tracking when vehicles have reached the end of their life cycle without having to complete a large amount of accounting by hand.

				<p>
				The system will be capable of carrying out tasks which a user with Manager credentials can use. The project primarily focuses on the "setting car rental rates", "adding new cars to the database", "printing receipts/ reports", and "adding/updating Customer/Dealer information."

			The above menttioned data flow diagrams display the interaction between the manager and the systems data structures. Starting with the Level 0 data flow, showing a very high level design with the manager interface interacting with the systems database. Level 1 Data Flow displays more detailed interaction between the manager and different objects in the system. It also describes the flow of the data through the system. Level 2 Data flow further elaborates a detailed description of the interaction between the manager interface and the data base by displaying the reports and components that will be used to interface with the database.

			<p>The SuperRent system is a web-based application which is designed upon a multi-layered architecture. The primary functions, which are to buy and sell new or used cars, are handled by a system divided into structure of five layers where the tasks to carry out these functions. The User Interface where all users will commonly interact with the application. An Application layer which handles what primary functions needs to be carried out dependent upon what the user needs. The Business layer tracks financial transactions and figures when car sales or rentals are made. The Data access layer to handle the information flow between the application and the database. Finally there is the Database layer, which is responsible for storing information regarding customers, employees, car inventory, car pricing, and rental rates. Utilising agile development and following the established architecture, the developers can ensure every project iteration is capable of carrying out the system’s main functions.

				<p>
				The components of the the SuperRent Management system are separated into their functional component groups. Coupling between components has been kept low to make sure that each component is as independent possible. Components such as Vehicle have been kept separated from components like Customer because there are intermediate components that complete process based on the two other components so they have no need to be coupled to each other. This increases component re-usability and also lowers the chance that modification to either component will cause dependency issues in other parts of the system.

				<p>
				The Database structure is based around three base tables. From VType, Locations, and customers the rest of the data base is built. VTypes references types of vehicles compact, economic, truck and so on. All other vehicle tables are children of this table. The hierarchy is Vtype to Vehicle model to vehicles that are then referenced by the remainder of the database. Customers are tracked based on there phone number which is placed as foreign keys inside reservations and rentals. Customer member ships are tracked in a separate table so that customers that don't have a membership don't waist space by having those empty fields. Rentals and Sales are tracked with there own ID's but are also connected to the customer and vehicle tables by the vehicle ID and Customer Phone number. This allows for those transactions to be searched based on location or customer through their customer an vehicle table relations.

					The application utilises a session java bean to track user actions when they log onto the application. The singleton design pattern ensures the existence of the current user's session whilst other users may also be logged onto the same application. This design pattern is primarily used when users logon the application, conduct functions which are connected to the database, and print receipts with information gathered from the the database.
				</p>
				<p>
					The functions are divided into java beans representing data entities and sessions. Whenever a user conducts any action, any of these java beans will hold onto the current user's login session and any information which was created or altered during the session.

		<p>	
			The Super Rent software tool will be developed using the Spiral Model. This iterative process model will allow
			for portions of the project to be brought on-line and tested before the project is completed. This gives the 
			Spiral Model the ability to allow for reassessment of requirements and design on each revolution. Each jump of 
			the spiral will bring new features on-line and allow time for testing of that feature before reassessment.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first revolution of the spiral will be modelling how the software will run. This will allow the team to discover
			any problems with either the design or requirements modelling thus far before heading to hard coding. Once the models
			and complete and accepted by the team they can move to the next spiral.
		</p>
		<p>
			The data base creation and data base interface will be the next spiral. Testing these data structures and there
			interface before piling code reliant on their specification will allow for smoother work in the next spiral.  
			This spiral will be mostly for hard data base creation and interface coding to allow for smooth and secure access 
			by all following software. Stress testing of the database will have to wait as no report system will be finished yet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now business valuable processes can start to be created. First the Modification and creation of data base entries must 
			be created to manage the data base previously created. This will allow for testing of the management software’s user 
			interface and find out if all the features required by the users is in the design for the data management system.
			After the Database management section is complete business logic can be implemented allowing for tagging of entries 
			based on criteria and the rental system implementation.  Also sale logic and interface will be added to allow managers to sell older vehicles. 
		<p/>
		<p>
			Once the final spiral is complete the manager system should be up and running if any extra requirements have been found 
			during previous cycles and new cycle can begin. If not final testing can be completed before the software is sent shipped

		<p>
			The project will take place over an approximate seven-month timeline. Follwing our established process model and estimating one month per project iteration, each iteration will prioritize upon functional requirements, design, implementation and testing. This iterative process will repeat until the project's expected completion date where the final system and acceptance tests will take place before release.
