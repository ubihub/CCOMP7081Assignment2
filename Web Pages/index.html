		<p>
		Super Rent is a rental business that rents vehicles of varying types, models and prices.They have to handle multiple locations in different cities. Each location handles reservations and rentals from a verity of customers. The management of these assets falls to the manager of each location.
		</p>
		<p>
		The Super Rent Manager software will allow managers at Super Rent branches around the city to manage their stores stock of vehicles. We will create a number of tools that will increase Manager’s productivity such as the ability to search vehicles in the system either by category, age or location. Also the manager will be able to update or add vehicle entries in the system.
		</p>
		<p>
		The system will allow the manager access to stored vehicle entries. It will provide tools to modify and create entries quickly and easily. Also vehicles can be quickly search based on location or type. Vehicles will be stored based on location and type from economy, compact, mid-size and etc.
		</p>
		<p>
		Managers will be allowed access to functionality to sell vehicles out of the system. This will allow proper procedure is followed when selling old vehicles that Super Rent doesn’t want anymore. This will allow for the company to make back a portion of their investment at the end of the vehicles life span. Well stream lining the process for all involved.
		</p>

	<p>
	The SuperRent car rental company requires manager level software. This system will implement a data base too store car information, and an interface to allow for business transactions and data manipulation. SuperRent rents a large number of vehicles of varying types, ages, values, and locations.
	</p>
	<p>
	This massive amount of information requires a system to streamline interaction between it and its users. SuperRent management needs this to access vehicle information across their many locations. Allow control over selling vehicles and tracking when vehicles have reached the end of their life cycle without having to complete a large amount of accounting by hand.

			<p>The SuperRent system is a web-based application which is designed upon a multi-layered architecture. The primary functions, which are to buy and sell new or used cars, are handled by a system divided into structure of five layers where the tasks to carry out these functions. The User Interface where all users will commonly interact with the application. An Application layer which handles what primary functions needs to be carried out dependent upon what the user needs. The Business layer tracks financial transactions and figures when car sales or rentals are made. The Data access layer to handle the information flow between the application and the database. Finally there is the Database layer, which is responsible for storing information regarding customers, employees, car inventory, car pricing, and rental rates. Utilising agile development and following the established architecture, the developers can ensure every project iteration is capable of carrying out the system’s main functions.

	<p>	
		The Super Rent software tool will be developed using the Spiral Model. This iterative process model will allow
		for portions of the project to be brought on-line and tested before the project is completed. This gives the 
		Spiral Model the ability to allow for reassessment of requirements and design on each revolution. Each jump of 
		the spiral will bring new features on-line and allow time for testing of that feature before reassessment.
	</p>
	<p>
		The first revolution of the spiral will be modelling how the software will run. This will allow the team to discover
		any problems with either the design or requirements modelling thus far before heading to hard coding. Once the models
		and complete and accepted by the team they can move to the next spiral.
	</p>
	<p>
		The data base creation and data base interface will be the next spiral. Testing these data structures and there
		interface before piling code reliant on their specification will allow for smoother work in the next spiral.  
		This spiral will be mostly for hard data base creation and interface coding to allow for smooth and secure access 
		by all following software. Stress testing of the database will have to wait as no report system will be finished yet.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now business valuable processes can start to be created. First the Modification and creation of data base entries must 
		be created to manage the data base previously created. This will allow for testing of the management software’s user 
		interface and find out if all the features required by the users is in the design for the data management system.
		After the Database management section is complete business logic can be implemented allowing for tagging of entries 
		based on criteria and the rental system implementation.  Also sale logic and interface will be added to allow managers to sell older vehicles. 
	<p/>
	<p>
		Once the final spiral is complete the manager system should be up and running if any extra requirements have been found 
		during previous cycles and new cycle can begin. If not final testing can be completed before the software is sent shipped
