<b><u>Process Model</u></b><br />
	The Super Rent software tool will be developed using the Spiral Model. This iterative process model will allow <br />
	for portions of the project to be brought on-line and tested before the project is completed. This gives the <br />
	Spiral Model the ability to allow for reassessment of requirements and design on each revolution. Each jump of <br />
	the spiral will bring new features on-line and allow time for testing of that feature before reassessment.<br />
	<br />
	The first revolution of the spiral will be modelling how the software will run. This will allow the team to discover<br/>
	any problems with either the design or requirements modelling thus far before heading to hard coding. Once the models<br />
	and complete and accepted by the team they can move to the next spiral.<br />
	<br />
	The data base creation and data base interface will be the next spiral. Testing these data structures and there<br />
	interface before piling code reliant on their specification will allow for smoother work in the next spiral. <br />
	This spiral will be mostly for hard data base creation and interface coding to allow for smooth and secure access <br />
	by all following software. Stress testing of the database will have to wait as no report system will be finished yet.<br />
	<br />
	Now business valuable processes can start to be created. First the Modification and creation of data base entries must <br />
	be created to manage the data base previously created. This will allow for testing of the management softwareâ€™s user <br />
	interface and find out if all the features required by the users is in the design for the data management system.<br />
	After the Database management section is complete business logic can be implemented allowing for tagging of entries <br />
	based on criteria and the rental system implementation.  Also sale logic and interface will be added to allow managers to sell older vehicles. <br />
	<br />
	Once the final spiral is complete the manager system should be up and running if any extra requirements have been found <br/>
	during previous cycles and new cycle can begin. If not final testing can be completed before the software is sent shipped<br />
