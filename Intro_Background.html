The Super Rent Manager software will allow managers at Super Rent branches around the city to 
 manage their stores stock of vehicles. We will create a number of tools that will increase 
 Manager's productivity such as the ability to search vehicles in the system either by 
 category, age or location. Also the manager will be able to update or add vehicle entries in the system.

	Managers will be allowed access to functionality to sell vehicles out of the system. 
	This will make sure proper procedure is followed when selling old vehicles that Super Rent 
	doesn't want any more. This will allow for the company to make back a portion of their 
	investment at the end of the vehicles life span. Well stream lining the process for all involved.

	data base too store car information, and an interface to allow for business transactions and
