<u><b>Super Rent for Managers Introduction</b></u> <br />
Super Rent is a rental business that rents vehicles of varying types, models and prices.<br />
 They have to handle multiple locations in different cities. Each location handles reservations <br />
 and rentals from a verity of customers. The management of these assets falls to the manager of <br />
 each location. <br /> <br /> 
The Super Rent Manager software will allow managers at Super Rent branches around the city to <br />
 manage their stores stock of vehicles. We will create a number of tools that will increase <br/> 
 Manager's productivity such as the ability to search vehicles in the system either by <br />
 category, age or location. Also the manager will be able to update or add vehicle entries in the system.<br />
 <br /> 
The system will allow the manager access to stored vehicle entries. It will provide tools to modify and create <br />
 entries quickly and easily. Also vehicles can be quickly searched based on location or type. Vehicles will be stored <br/>
 based on location and type from economy, compact, mid-size and est. <br/>
 <br />
	Managers will be allowed access to functionality to sell vehicles out of the system. <br />
	This will make sure proper procedure is followed when selling old vehicles that Super Rent <br />
	doesn't want any more. This will allow for the company to make back a portion of their <br />
	investment at the end of the vehicles life span. Well stream lining the process for all involved.<br />
	<br />
	<u><b>Background</b></u><br />
	The SuperRent car rental company requires manager level software. This system will implement a <br />
	data base too store car information, and an interface to allow for business transactions and <br />
	data manipulation. SuperRent rents a large number of vehicles of varying types, ages, values, <br/>

	This massive amount of information requires a system to streamline interaction between it <br />
	and its users. SuperRent management needs this to access vehicle information across <br/>
	their many locations. Allow control over selling vehicles and tracking when vehicles have reached <br />
	the end of their life cycle without having to complete a large amount of accounting by hand. <br />
